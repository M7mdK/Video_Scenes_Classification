# Video_Scenes_Classification

In this project we use Machine Learning in Python to perform video scences classification into violent and non-violent videos.
After extensive work towards our final model, we managed to reach 94% accuracy on a dataset of videos from mixed resources.

- This is my Bachelor Senior Project (2020), done as a group work with my collegues Mohamad Bazzal & Mohamad Jaffal under the supervision of Prof. Siba Haidar.
- This was our first experience in the Artificial intelligence domain. Also, the first time we use python and getting to know its libraries. So, most of the time spent during the project was on learning and digging deep into the domain on our own with a continuous support from Dr. Siba.
